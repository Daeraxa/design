## Overview

The select panel allows you to select one or multiple items from a list, and it can be enhanced with additional controls like a search input to expedite the selection process. It is commonly employed to add information to various sections of a website.

For instance, you may encounter a select panel when you need to assign someone to a task or add labels to an issue or pull request. It can also be utilized to select a specific branch in a code repository.

It's important to understand the differences between the select panel and [action menu](action-menu). The primary distinction lies in the fact that an action menu lacks the ability to include additional form controls and automatically closes after making a selection. Therefore, if you require a filterable list or the capability to make multiple selections at once, the select panel is the appropriate choice.

## Anatomy

Search input with a magnifer icon as a visible label, listbox of label options and the first three are selected with a visual checkbox. The footer contains a button to edit labels, and cancel and apply buttons. Purple labels are overlayed onto select panel: Overlay (dialog) pointing to the container, Search input pointing to the input, role='listbox' bracket of the listbox content, Optional action control to the button in the lower left corner, Explicit confirm / submission buttons bracket for the apply and cancel buttons in the lower right corner."

## Options

The select panel provides flexibility by offering both simple list-based single selection and multi-selection options. Additionally, it can become more sophisticated by incorporating advanced features such as filtering functionality and the inclusion of links.

/>

### Selection type

Select panels can either be a single or multi selection whereby each type has additional features.

#### Multi select

<img
  width="960"
  alt="Multi-select"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/b2900316-850b-4302-bd88-552dc31ea3ad"
/>

The multi-select option allows you to choose multiple items from a list and has additional features like `select all` or `indeterminate selections`.

The `select all` option at the top of the list allows for quickly deselecting or selecting all values however when used grouping within the list isn't possible anymore.
It also can only be used when all available options can be returned. For example if the list is too large to retrieve all options at once, such as when using API endpoints with limited results then this feature may not be suitable.
We should also refrain from putting strain on API endpoints to return all the possible results and this could result in a performance downgrade since virtualization is currently not built into this component.

The `intermediate selections` option is useful for performing bulk actions on lists. For example, if you have 20 selected items, but some of them have different labels attached, an indeterminate checkbox (represented by a horizontal line) is shown for labels that are not set on all items.
This feature has less limitation than the `select all` option and therefore can be applied everywhere we provide bulk actions within lists.

#### Single select

/>

### Loading

It is important to provide visual cues to the user when certain processes may take longer than expected. Loading states can be utilized at different stages of using a component to communicate this information effectively.

<img
  width="1668"
  alt="First select panel is a branch switcher control that includes tabs, a search input, a listbox with single-select items, and a footer with an All branches link, and cancel and apply buttons. Second select panel is titled 'Show fields, with a list of about 10 multi-select items and apply and cancel buttons in the footer."
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/f9f118f3-5830-4ce6-8981-5ea7afd56894"
/>

1. **Initial**: This loading state is used when retrieving the initial data to prevent users from seeing an empty list. Skeleton loaders can be used if the data is expected to arrive within 500 milliseconds.
2. **Searching/Filtering**: When users perform a search to fetch new items, it is important to maintain their current selections or allow them to continue making selections. In this case, a more minimal loading state should be used to indicate ongoing activity.
3. **Confirmation**: If your layout does not incorporate optimistic updates or lacks error messaging for failed updates, it is crucial to use a confirmation button as a loading state to clearly communicate the progress of the update.

By employing these loading states, users can have a better understanding of the process and remain informed throughout their interactions with the component.

### Limit selections

Second select panel is titled 'Show fields, with a list of about 10 multi-select items and apply and cancel buttons in the footer."
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/9cacdd30-99b3-4571-b37f-3066b7219ab2"
/>

In certain situations, we may need to restrict the number of items a user can select, either due to infrastructure limitations or limitations based on paid features. It is important to inform the user about this restriction before they begin making their selection. The description can be used effectively to communicate this limitation.

When the user reaches the maximum allowed number of selections, we need to display a warning message indicating that they have reached their limit. This can also be an opportunity to provide a link for upgrading their account if the restriction is related to a paid feature. It is worth noting that the warning message is labeled with an `aria-live` attribute, ensuring that users with screen readers receive immediate notification when the message appears.

### Trigger

<Caption>
  Select panels can be triggered through a button or an icon button. For select panels that display the selection in a
  button, a label must be persist either internally or externally.

### Footers

/>
<Caption>
  An optional control slot is available at the bottom of the select panel. This could be a single link, button or
  checkbox to take additional actions.
</Caption>

### Cancel/Submit

To determine whether we need cancel/submit buttons in the footer of the select panel, let's first understand the distinction between passive and active selections.

Passive selections occur when the select panel doesn't immediately save the chosen data to a database upon closing the select panel dialog. In other words, the selection is temporarily stored until the user completes their actions or submits the form that includes the select panel. For example, this can be seen in a button that triggers a select panel within a form that needs to be submitted.

On the other hand, active selections involve immediate data writing to the database upon making a selection or closing the select panel dialog. It is crucial to be cautious with active selections to avoid triggering unintended workflows or creating interactions without explicit confirmation from the user. For instance, accidentally assigning an issue to the wrong user, who then receives a notification. This can be particularly frustrating for users with accessibility needs, who might make unintended selections more easily. To prevent such issues, it is important to provide a cancel and apply button, allowing users to review and confirm their choices.

Examples of passive selections:

- Filtering data
- Switching branches in a code repository
- Selection within a form

Examples of active selections:

- Adding labels to an item
- Assigning users to an issue
- Sending invites

We recommend assuming an active selection for less frequently used parts of the platform to avoid accessibility concerns. However, it is important to understand that in areas of the platform that are used frequently, users may want to perform actions as quickly as possible instead of having to confirm their selection each single time.

| Selection | Cancel/Save | Type    | Visual    | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Single    | Yes         | Active  | Radio     | View    |
| Single    | No          | Passive | Checkmark | View    |
| Multiple  | Yes         | Active  | Checkbox  | View    |
| Multiple  | No          | Passive | Checkbox  | View    |

By understanding these differences, we can design the select panel in a way that respects user intentions, avoids unintended actions, and minimizes frustrations, especially for users with accessibility requirements.

### Error/Warning

<img

  alt="Error"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/135d597a-33cd-4ba1-a86b-241a1b5bdfcb"
/>

Sometimes, we encounter situations where things don't work as expected, or we need to inform users about something important. There are various ways to handle these scenarios depending on the situation.

For instance, if the default values fail to load initially, we display an error placeholder to let the user know that something went wrong.

When the initial values are loaded and the user performs a search for new values, there may be instances where the search fails. In such cases, it is essential to ensure that the user can still make a selection without losing their current selection. Instead, we display an error message at the top of the list, notifying the user about the search failure while preserving their ability to continue with their selection process.

For errors we should always include a link to our support page to ensure that users have a way to reach out to us for assistance.

## Best practices

### Be predictable

### Responsive

On smaller breakpoints the select panel could become either a full screen dialog or a bottom sheet dialog.
The confirmations buttons and action list items also are changed to medium to ensure that the hit target is large enough for touch devices.

When including an additional action in the footer also make sure that this still fit on a 320px viewport.
